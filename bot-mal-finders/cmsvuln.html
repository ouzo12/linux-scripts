<h2>Web site/CMS Vulnerability Remediation</h2>
<h2>CMS Infections in General</h2>
<p>
Many CMS infections are due to the StealRat botnet, it should be
the first to check.
This <a href=http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-stealrat.pdf>link</a> is a Trend Micro PDF describing
the infection in copious detail.
While the PDF should be consulted for full information, checking for
mysterious/unexplained PHP scripts in wp-content/plugins (if you're
running Wordpress) directories should get you started.
This <a href="http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/how-to-check-if-your-website-is-part-of-the-stealrat-botnet/">link</a> has
instructions for a more directed search for it.
</p>
<p>
Finding Stealrat can be as simple as running the following command on UNIX-like
systems - for "[dirs]", substitute in the web server document root, CGI
and image directories:
<pre class=notranslate>
 find [dirs] -print | xargs -d'\n' grep 'die(PHP_OS.chr(49).chr(48).chr(43).md5(0987654321'
</pre>
<p>
If the above doesn't work, don't assume you are not infected.  The
Malware may have changed, or you didn't search the right directories.
Keep searching.
</p>
<p>
Our <a href="/findbot.pl">findbot perl script</a> has been enhanced to find
Stealrat.
However, we cannot guarantee that findbot.pl will find all copies of
malware.
</p>
<p>
<font color=red>New:</font>
<a href="http://www.melani.admin.ch/dienstleistungen/00132/01593/index.html?lang=en">MELANI</a> is a Swiss computer security/analysis center, and the link
has general instructions on how to clean up CMS (Content Management Systems
like Drupal or Wordpress) sites from infection.
</p>
<p>
In virtually all cases, these infections are injected onto the victim
servers by means of vulnerabilities in the CMS software (eg: Drupal, Wordpress, etc).
It is critically important that <strong>everyone</strong> using CMS keep them patched up to date:
</p>
<ul><a href="https://en-ca.wordpress.org/download/">Official Wordpress Downloads</a></ul>
<ul><a href="http://www.joomla.org/download.html">Official Joomla Downloads</a></ul>
<ul><a href="https://www.drupal.org/download">Official Drupal Downloads</a></ul>
<ul><a href="https://www.typo3.org/download">Official Typo3 Downloads</a></ul>
</p>
<p>
If you are running Drupal, make sure that the patches referred to <a href="https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2013-003">here</a> are applied.
If you're running Drupal you should upgrade to the latest versions.
</p>
<p>
Of late some of these infections are facilitiated by a <a href="/sshvuln.html">SSH Rootkit</a> called
"ebury".
See the link for more detail.
</p>
<p>
In most cases, this IP address would be that of a shared hosting
environment.
If you are a customer of this environment, you will almost certainly
not be able to do anything about it, only the administrators of the hosting
environment itself can.
Please contact your administrators, and refer them to this page.
</p>
<p>
If the administrators are reluctant to do anything please try to
convince them, because there is nothing you can do to fix this problem.
</p>
<h2>For the System Administrators</h2>
<p>
Your task is to find the current problem, fix it, and prevent it
from happening again.
</p>
<h3>Finding the problem by network activity: Linux/FreeBSD etc</h3>
<p>
One way of finding the user that is infected and spewing spam is to
use the "lsof" (list open files) utility.
"lsof" is available for most versions of UNIX-like systems such as Linux
as part
of the official distribution, but may not be installed by default.
So first, make sure you have it installed.  On many systems such as Ubuntu,
you can install it by:
</p>
<pre class="notranslate">
sudo apt-get install lsof
</pre>
<p>
Once lsof is installed, you can issue the following command
<pre class="notranslate">
sudo lsof -i | grep smtp
</pre>
<p>
You may see a number of lines, such as (example.com takes the place of your machine's name):
</p>
<pre class="notranslate">
sendmail- 18520 root  3u IPv4 3016693 0t0 TCP *:smtp (LISTEN)
sendmail   4401 mail 13u IPv4 8742322 0t0 TCP example.com:42177->mail1.hotmail.com:smtp (ESTABLISHED)
exim       6348 mail  3u IPv4 210565067 0t0 TCP *:smtp (LISTEN)
find       4403  foo 13u IPv4 8742322 0t0 TCP example.com:42176->mtain-dk.r1000.mx.aol.com:smtp (ESTABLISHED)
</pre>
<p>
The first line, for example, is your sendmail mail software "LISTEN"ing (as userid root)
for inbound email connections - this is normal.
The second line is sendmail "caught" at the moment of sending an email (as userid
"mail") from your
machine to a hotmail server - that is also perfectly normal.
You may see similar lines with "exim" or "postfix" or "smtpd" or "qmail" instead of sendmail -
all depending on what mail server you run - example - the third line is an Exim listener.
The important thing that indicates that it's normal is that the userid is "mail" or
"mailman" or something like that - <strong>NOT</strong> an ordinary user.
</p>
</p>
The fourth line is a program called "find", running under userid "foo" making a connection
to an AOL server.
</p>
<p>
It's examples like the fourth line you're looking for - it tells you the userid of the infected
user.  In this case it also indicates that the infection is masquerading as the program "find".
There will often be more than one of these.
</p>
<p>
Simply killing these processes is <strong>NOT</strong> enough, because they will often
restart on their own.
You will need to find whether these are started by a cron job owned by that user,
or, spawned through your web server, or started from a ssh login.
Find and delete the program - often a PHP or Perl script.
In some cases, however, the program deletes itself as soon as it starts.
The "find" example above is a Linux binary executable that contains an encrypted
perl script.
Since this was first written, it now sometimes masquerades as "mail" or
"ntpd".
Assume it could be anything.
You will also need to find out how the script got installed on your machine - often through
Joomla, Wordpress, Cpanel or Plesk security holes, or ftp upload and secure it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>WARNING</strong> Just because you didn't find a line like the "foo" line
above doesn't mean the machine is not infected!
It just means that the machine is not sending email at the instant lsof was run.
If you don't see a line like the "foo" line, we suggest that you run the lsof command
multiple times. Example:
</p>
<pre class="notranslate">
while true
do
    sudo lsof -i | grep smtp
    sleep 10
done
</pre>
<h3>Finding the problem by finding the script: Linux/FreeBSD</h3>
<p>
<font size=+3 color="red"><blink>NEW!</blink></font> There's a new version
of findbot that should find CryptoPHP faster and simpler - try the -c option.
</p>
<p>
There are a number of scanners that can be used on web servers
to try to find malicious PHP and Perl scripts, such as rkhunter etc.
</p>
<p>
With the assistance of others, we've written
a simple perl script called
<a href="/findbot.pl">findbot.pl</a>
that searches for such things as r57shell, cryptphp etc.
It will search your system can find potentially dangerous scripts.
</p>
<p>
As it's very simple-minded you will have to carefully inspect the
files it finds to verify whether what it finds is malicious or not.
Be aware of the file types - finding executable code fragments within
".png" or ".jpg" files is clearly demonstrates that the file is malicious.
</p>
<p>
In order to use <a href="/findbot.pl">findbot.pl</a>, you will need
Perl installed.

<ul>
<li>Install perl if necessary </li>
<li>Download <a href="/findbot.pl">findbot.pl</a></li>
<li>Follow the instructions at the beginning of the findbot.pl file</li>
</ul>
<h3>Armoring PHP against infections</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://suhosin.org">Suhosin</a> may be a useful tool to
protect your PHP environment from various malware.
</p>
<p>
Many of these infections start themselves running, and then delete themselves from
disk.
Which means you won't be able to find it.
Check your ftp and SSH logs for suspicious files and logins.
This is why it's so important to prevent it happening again.
</p>
<p>
One additional way of finding this infection that works for
some variants is to
run the "file" command (you may have to install it - eg:
"sudo apt-get install file") on the suspicious program.
</p>
<p>
"ELF 32-bit and "corrupted section header size" from the example
below means that you've probably found the right file:
<pre>
$ file sshd
sshd:  ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (FreeBSD), statically
linked, corrupted section header size
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The above test can be used in bulk, using either of the following
two commands:
<pre class="notranslate">
file /path/to/directory/* | grep 'corrupted section'
find /path1 /path2 -print | xargs -d'\n' file | grep 'corrupted section'
</pre>
If you find such a file, please send us copies.
</p>
<h3>Finding the problem by network activity: Windows</h3>
<p>
The Windows environment is rather less developed for finding these
things than UNIX-like systems.
However, we can recommend the tcpview tool, so please see
<a href="/advanced.html#tcpview">tcpview/tcpconn</a> in our advanced section.
<h3>Finding the problem by logs: (Mostly) Linux/FreeBSD</h3>
<p>
Most of these scripts are quite good at hiding their presence.  Some
of them start up, and them remove the on-disk copy, so there's nothing
to see.
None of them volunteer where they are, so samples don't help.
Most of these scripts bypass your mail server software, so there
is nothing to see in the mail logs or queues.
</p>
<p>
However, they all do need to get on your system somehow, and that
often leaves logs.
If you can find those log records, often that will help you identify
the infected user and find the malicious files (if they are still there).
</p>
<p>
Generally speaking, these are the ways malicious scripts get onto a system:
<al>
<li>
Web sites often make FTP or SSL available so their customers can upload
content or log in to manage their web pages.
If the customer's computer is compromised with a keylogger, it means
that the criminal can upload anything they want.
You can usually see this activity in your FTP or SSL logs - look for 
uploads of .php or .pl files, lots of oddly named files, access from 
a large variety of IP addresses, etc.
If you do find something like this, it's important to get the user to
change their password, and do virus scans of their computers.
</li>
<li>
Check your web server for large quantities of requests to the same PHP
or CGI or Perl file, or POST commands, etc...
This can reveal where the infection is, and often how it got there.
</li>
<li>
Most CMSes, in particular, Plesk, CPanel, Wordpress
and Joomla quite simply have severe security holes being found in them,
seemingly daily, and hosted environments are often reluctant to keep up to
date with their patching.
You may never find a reasonable explanation of how the malicious software
got there
</li>
</al>

<h3>Preventing it Happening Again</h3>
<al>
<li>
Make absolutely certain that ALL CMS software (Joomla, Cpanel, Wordpress, Plesk etc) is
kept up to date at all times. 
Do not let your users make any excuses for not doing so.
</li>
<li>
Make it impossible for such infections (and they will happen again) to spam the world
by implementing the blocking of email sent direct from the machine without going through
your mail server.
<p>
Some of your customers may believe that they need to be allowed to do this.
The best answer for them is to configure their software to relay it through the
mail server software on the machine or to an external smart-host.
</p>
<p>
For blocking: With Cpanel you can use ConfigServer Security Firewall (CSF).
It's free.
CSF has the "SMTP_BLOCK" configuration option - turn it on.
</p>
<p>
Basic Cpanel, there's also "WHM SMTP Tweak" would should also help.
</p>
<p>
The following is an equivalent for non-Cpanel installations - it permits
local mail submission and blocks external mail submission:
<pre class="notranslate">
iptables -A OUTPUT -d 127.0.0.1 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 25 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 25 -m owner --gid-owner mail -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 25 -m owner --gid-owner mailman -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 25 -m owner --uid-owner root -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 25 -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-port-unreachable
</pre>
<p>
The above permits users to send mail via a local mail server, permits local mail server
software (running under userid root, or gid mail or mailman)
to send email to the Internet, but prevents any ordinary user making direct
SMTP connections to the Internet.
You may have to adjust this for Qmail or Exim.  Check which userids are used.
Note that the iptables settings will probably be lost next time you reboot.
</p>
<p>
Many versions of Linux (Debian, Ubuntu etc) have a package called "iptables-persistent".
You can install this package ("sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent")
and manage your boot-time iptables entries using it.
</p>
<p>
If you're using cPanel and APF, APF by default will wipe out iptables
rules you enter manually leaving the server vulnerable.
If you are using APF, you should make the above change via APF and
that will take care of reissuing the commands upon reboot or reset.
</p>
</li>
<li>
Do you really need PHP script support?  CGI support?  PHP mail functions?
Turn off the ones you don't need.  Some people, for example, turn off CGIs,
and PHP "fsocketopen" or "exec" functions in the PHP ini files (either
for the whole site, or individual environments), and manage to
inhibit many infections.
</li>
<li>
Some of these scripts get installed into /tmp.
If /tmp is a separate file system, you can stop it being used
by malicious scripts by adjusting the /etc/fstab file to mount /tmp
with the "noexec" and "nosuid" flags.
This means that the O/S will not run programs that are in the /tmp directory nor
treat them as setuid.
</li>
<li>
Turn off customer FTP if you don't need it.
Note that some CMS packages install FTP with anonymous FTP turned
on by default.  This is ALWAYS a bad idea, so make sure "anonymous
login" is turned off.
</li>
<li>
It is necessary to force password changes on those users whose web sites
have been compromised.
If you can't tell exactly which users have been compromised, it's strongly
recommended you change all passwords.
</li>
</al>
